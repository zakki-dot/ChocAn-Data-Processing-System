# ChocAn-Data-Processing-System

The ChocAn Data Processing System is a command line program for managing employee and provider payroll records. It uses an object-oriented design with Person, Member, and Provider classes to store user data. Providers facilitate services for members, with fees and service codes stored in provider_directory.txt. A hash table-based system enables efficient data retrieval, storing information in list_of_members.txt and list_of_providers.txt. The system has two main interfaces: Provider Terminal (for logging in, checking in members, and viewing records) and Manager Terminal (for adding/removing users, generating reports, and managing payroll). Transactions are securely recorded in provider and member records, ensuring data integrity and persistence across sessions.

To run the program, compile it with make or g++ -o main main.cpp menu.cpp class.cpp -std=c++11, then execute ./main. Users select between the Provider or Manager terminal, logging in with their credentials. Providers check in members and record services, while managers oversee payroll, reports, and user management. The system automatically saves all data before exiting, ensuring all updates are retained.
